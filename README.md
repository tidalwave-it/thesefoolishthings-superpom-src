TheseFoolishThings - SuperPOM
================================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings-superpom-src/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings-superpom-src/latest)

A feature-rich SuperPOM for building Java projects. It features:

* explicit version configuration for a number of plugins;
* easy configurability by means of pre-defined properties to avoid cut & copy of plugin sections.

A number of profiles, easily activatable, are available for:

* Spring-AOP configuration;
* different kinds of Continous Integration tasks, including a full run of QA tools such as JaCoCo, FindBugs, PMD, etc...
* deploying WARs and locally running them with Tomcat or Jetty;
* creating a Mac OS X bundle for JavaFX applications;
* a customized release cycle, including all requirements for the Maven Central such as signing, with a 'transactional' behaviour
  (all artifacts, both the DSCM and the Maven artifacts are prepared on the local disk, so they can be uploaded in a second moment);
